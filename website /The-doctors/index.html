    <p><img src="../index photos/2QTV3Fn copy.png" alt="" width="424" height="250" class="insertimage"/>The character of the Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. All that was known about him in the programme's early days was that he was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the &quot;TARDIS&quot; (an acronym for time and relative dimension(s) in space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality referred to as &quot;dimensional transcendentality&quot;).</p>
    <p> The initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure. It was eventually revealed that he had been on the run from his own people, the Time Lords of the planet Gallifrey.</p></td>
