    <td><h1>Luke Rattigan </h1>      <p><img src="images/luke-rattigan.jpg" alt="luke" width="250" height="250" class="insertimage">Luke Rattigan is one of the main antagonists from &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; and &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;. He was a child prodigy. When he was twelve years old, he invented the powerful Fountain 6 search engine, which made him a millionaire overnight. He created the Rattigan Academy, a special school for young geniuses handpicked from all over the world. Luke worked in league with the Sontarans to conquer Earth. He constructed a satellite navigation/CO2 emission reduction system called ATMOS (ATMOSpheric Emissions System), which was installed in 50% of all cars worldwide (approximately 400,000,000 cars overall). The Sontarans promised Rattigan a planet for terraforming, Castor 36, which Rattigan affectionately names &quot;Earth.2&quot;. Rattigan intends to take some of his most intelligent students with him to Castor 36, though they refuse. Later, when Rattigan reports this failure to General Staal, he learns that upon his students' arrival on the Sontaran ship, they would have been used as target practice: Castor 36 never existed, and the Sontarans only hired him to install the ATMOS systems. Having been betrayed, he sacrifices himself to save the Doctor by using a device originally intended for atmospheric conversion to destroy the Sontaran vessel, redeeming himself. Luke Rattigan is played by the actor Ryan Sampson.</p>    </td>
